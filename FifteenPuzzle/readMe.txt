A readme for the FifteenPuzzle class for Java

Created Winter 2017 for Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Acquisition

This project is included for the sake of completeness as currently it isn't usable. Most of the code was retrofitted in order to fit the requirements for the assignment.

This project is designed to solve 15-puzzles using a variety of algorithms including: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Greedy best-first search (using two different heuristics), A* (using two different hueristics), and depth-limited search. 

The BoardTree class contains the methods for each search type.
