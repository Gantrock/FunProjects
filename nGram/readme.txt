A readme for the NGram test class for Java

Created Summer 2017 for Intro to NLP

This project involved solving three problems using a particular system for each. All three programs were originally included with a seperate file NGramTester. Each class has been modified from it's original form so that it can be used with any plaintext file placed in the same folder. In addition each file may have had some modifications in order to ensure academic integrity.

It should be noted that these classes are designed to create output reports so (minimal) caution should be taken if compiled.

The first is Unigram. This class tracks every instance of a unique word from the provided training files (public domain copies of "A Scandal in Bohemia" by Arthur Conan Doyle) and calculates the probability of each word word being randomly selected.

The second is Bigram. This class creates and tracks bigrams in the training files.

The third is SmoothedBigram. It is the same class as Bigram but with addÎ´ smoothing.
